    <p>For more than two decades, J. August Jewelry Consignment, located in Amherst, New Hampshire, has specialized in custom jewelry design, repair and restoration.</p>
    <p>As New England's largest consignment jewelry store, we are experts in creating made-to-order redesigns of old jewelry pieces and new designs for unset stones.

    <p>Our jewelry boutique offers a spectrum of beautiful sapphires, emeralds, rubies, and other fine colored gemstones, as well as a wide variety of designer watches, wedding bands, pendants, estate jewelry, clocks and other antiques and collectibles. We offer unbeatable prices on Tiffany's, David Yurman, Rolex, Seiko and other upscale designer consignment pieces.</p>
