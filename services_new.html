August Jewelry Consignment offers the highest prices - paid in cash - for gold and sterling silver, which we use for our repair work.</p>

    <p>Below is some information about our consignment policies. Please contact us if you have additional questions about consigning your jewelry.</p>
    <p>We reserve the option to decline anything we feel is not saleable. Items should be cleaned and polished and not chipped or broken.</p>
